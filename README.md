# Diamonds Dataset Analysis with Apache Spark SQL

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the diamonds dataset using Apache Spark SQL in the Databricks Community Edition. The dataset will be explored both in tabular form and visually, followed by the calculation of machine learning models.

## Dataset Description
The diamonds dataset contains information about various attributes of diamonds such as carat weight, cut, clarity, and price. It is sourced from the ggplot2 package in R, providing detailed documentation on the variables.

## Data Understanding with Spark SQL
Using Spark SQL, the dataset will be thoroughly described, including statistical summaries, distribution analysis, and visualization of key attributes.
